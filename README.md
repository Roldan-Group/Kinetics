# Kinetics

Kinetics code allows building Matlab inputs to calculate:
- thermodynamic properties of the different speces: Cp, H, S and G
- reaction constants
- constant temperature kinetics
- variable temperature kinetics
- temperature programmed desorptions
- further analyses will be implemented soon

according to the process described in the mechanisms included and the reaction conditions specified.

# Usage

Upon having Prior to run Kinetics2Matlab
